# Hand Tracking and Joint Detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe

##  Overview
This project performs **real-time hand tracking** and **joint (landmark) detection** using OpenCV and Google's MediaPipe library.  
It captures video from the webcam, detects hands, and draws 21 key landmarks on each hand with smooth tracking performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- MediaPipe  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
